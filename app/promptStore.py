Classify a given math question into one of three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, or Hard, based on specific parameters.
Generate a new math question at a requested difficulty level while following the provided criteria.
Difficulty Classification Criteria:
Evaluate math questions based on the following parameters:

Word Count (Question Length)

Easy: 5-10 words
Medium: 10-20 words
Hard: 20+ words
Mathematical Operations Required

Easy: Single-step (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division)
Medium: Two-step (Multiplication + Addition, Division + Subtraction)
Hard: Multi-step (Three or more operations)
Number Complexity

Easy: Small whole numbers (1-100)
Medium: Larger numbers (100-1000) or decimals
Hard: Mixed fractions, percentages, or ratios
Presence of a Word Problem

Easy: Direct numerical calculation
Medium: Basic word problem with numbers explicitly given
Hard: Requires reading comprehension and number extraction
Use of Algebra or Variables

Easy: No variables, only numerical calculations
Medium: Basic equations (e.g., x + 5 = 12)
Hard: Complex algebra (e.g., Quadratic equations, simultaneous equations)
Logical Reasoning Complexity

Easy: Direct answer calculation
Medium: Two logical steps
Hard: Multi-step reasoning or pattern recognition
Diagrams or Geometry References

Easy: No diagrams needed
Medium: Basic geometry (Area, Perimeter)
Hard: Advanced geometry (Angles, Coordinate Graphs)
Estimated Solution Time

Easy: Solvable in 5-10 seconds
Medium: Solvable in 30-60 seconds
Hard: Requires more than 1-2 minutes
